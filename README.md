# MongoDB $inc operator error
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in a MongoDB update query. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. In this case, the value provided is a string, which leads to an error or unexpected behavior.

The correct way to use `$inc` is to provide a numeric value for the increment, not a string.
